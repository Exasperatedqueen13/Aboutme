Doughnuts (medu vada): 
1) Drain the soaked urad dal and grind/blend to a coarse paste, you may need to add around 10ml water to aid the process (refrain from adding any more water than necessary).<br> <br>
2) Place the urad dal paste in a large bowl and add all the above ingredients except for the onions and the coriander. Beat the mixture for about 3-4 minutes and set aside. Fold in the onions and coriander.<br> <br>

3) Heat enough oil to deep fry to 150C.<br> <br>

4) Wet your hand in a bowl of cold water and take a ping-pong ball-sized piece of the medu vada mixture and roll it in your hand. Make a hole in the middle with your thumb to give it a doughnut shape. Try not to press the dough too much or they may come out flat.
<br> <br>
5) Gently release the doughnut shape into the hot oil, they will sink to the bottom and slowly rise up to the surface. Fry on medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, just as if they were doughnuts, making sure they are thoroughly cooked in the middle. Carry on shaping and frying rest of the medu vadas.
<br> <br>
6) Drain on a kitchen paper when the medu vadas are golden and crispy all over. Serve hot with a steaming bowl of Sambhar (lentil soup) and Coriander hcutney (recipes follow).
<br> <br> <br>
Lentil soup (sambhar): 
1) To make the paste, roast all of the dry ingredients in a saute pan for about 3-4 minutes or until they become aromatic. Grind and set aside.
<br> <br>
2) In the same saute pan, heat the oil and add all the other sambhar paste ingredients and stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes. Place in a blender along with the dry roasted masalas and blend together. You may need to add 10-20ml water to aid the blending process. Set this paste aside until needed.
<br> <br>
3) Pressure cook the toover dal in 500ml boiling water for around 15 minutes on a medium heat or until almost pureed. Allow to cool, the sieve the pureed dal into a bowl to remove any husks. Set aside.
<br> <br>
4) In a large pan heat the clarified butter/oil. Add the mustard seeds, wait for them to pop, and then add the cumin seeds and asafoetida. Throw in the curry leaves and chopped onions and fry until translucent.
<br> <br>
5) Add the tomato puree, tamarind concentrate, turmeric powder, the sambhar paste and 100ml boiling water, and cook for 3-4 minutes.
<br> <br>
6) Add the boiled toover dal with about 500ml boiling water and bring to boil again. Add the vegetables and simmer for 5-8 minutes taking care not to overcook them.
<br> <br>
7) Just before turning off the heat, add the cinnamon powder and star anise powder, lemon juice, salt and sugar. Stir through and cover. Garnish with chopped coriander immediately before serving with the doughnuts and chutney.
<br> <br>
Note: Remember to taste the sambhar before serving. It should be hot, sweet and sour. This soup can also be served with rice, dosas and idli.
<br> <br> <br>
Coconut and coriander chutney: 
1) In a large bowl, soak the coconut in the coconut milk and set aside.
<br> <br>
2) Meanwhile, blend together all other ingredients except the yogurt using a food processor or pestle and mortar.
<br> <br>
3) Mix the blended ingredients with the soaked coconut and yogurt. Combine thoroughly and serve </div>
